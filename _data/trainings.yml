  Description: >-
      This class is based on case studies of real life web application vulnerabilities. Participants are given a hands-on experience by learning each vulnerability category and completing a series of challenges at the end of each day. Participants will also get an in depth understanding of reconnaissance and automation process which will enable them to increase their attack surface in order to find more vulnerabilities. This course comes with challenges to learn the basics of each vulnerability as well as a mock infrastructure/organization to provide a real world scenario on how to approach a target and look for different vulnerabilities.

  Description: >-
      The AppSec: Secure Coding and DevSecOps (ASCD) course introduces fundamental concepts about the best practices of secure development and security automation within a development process.Every day, new flaws are discovered in several systems, be it a web or mobile application, a custom software, or a third-party component used by an application. For a long time and even today, it is possible to come across the web or mobile applications designed with weaknesses in their development process.In this training, we will cover basic secure development techniques. Students will understand application security vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10 list, and learn strategies to defend against them using proactive, secure development controls. Several topics will be covered, such as HTTP Protocol, Application Security, Secure Development Cycle (SDL), OWASP and its various projects and tools, Application Security Testing such as DAST, SAST, and SCA, DevOps, and DevSecOps, among others.
