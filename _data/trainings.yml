  Description: >-
      This class is based on case studies of real life web application vulnerabilities. Participants are given a hands-on experience by learning each vulnerability category and completing a series of challenges at the end of each day. Participants will also get an in depth understanding of reconnaissance and automation process which will enable them to increase their attack surface in order to find more vulnerabilities. This course comes with challenges to learn the basics of each vulnerability as well as a mock infrastructure/organization to provide a real world scenario on how to approach a target and look for different vulnerabilities.
