  SectionId: sku_KSM
  Description: >-
      Kubernetes has emerged as the leading container orchestration and management platform for on-prem and cloud environments. However, Kubernetes is a multi-headed beast with several minute and nuanced security configuration parameters. In addition, attackers take 
      advantage of these insecurely configured and designed Kubernetes deployments and perform deep-incursions into the organization’s assets. This training is a hard-core hands-on view of Kubernetes Security from an Attack and Defense perspective. The course takes the 
      participants through a journey where they start with setting up a Kubernetes cluster (simulating an on-prem Kubernetes) deployment, attack the cluster and learn, through multiple deep-dive examples and cookbooks on how they can effectively secure Kubernetes clusters. 
      The course is aimed at providing a view of attacking, auditing and defending Kubernetes clusters on-prem or on the cloud

  Description: >-
    This is the latest edition of our threat modeling trainings released at Black Hat USA 2021, with a new threat modeling war game with red and blue threat modeling teams. Engaged in capture the flag style threat modeling challenges your team will battle for control over an offshore wind turbine park. Based on our experience in securing real-world Operational Technology (OT) infrastructure.
    Also, in this edition we enhanced the sections on agile and DevOps threat modeling, threat modeling and compliance, added a section on "threat modeling at scale" and all participants get our Threat Modeling Playbook plus one-year access to our online threat modeling training subscription.
    As highly skilled professionals, we know that there is a gap between academic knowledge of threat modeling and the real world. To minimize that gap, we developed practical Use Cases, based on real-life projects. Each use case includes a description of the environment, together with questions and templates to build a threat model. Using this methodology for the hands-on workshops we provide our students with a robust training experience and the templates to incorporate threat modeling best practices in their daily work.
    Students will be challenged in groups of 3 to 4 people to perform the different stages of threat modeling on the following<br>
    • Threat modeling an IoT gateway with a cloud-based update service<br>
    • Get into the defender's head – modeling points of attack against a nuclear facility<br>
    • Threat mitigations of OAuth scenarios for an HR application<br>
    • Privacy analysis of a new face recognition system in an airport<br>
    • Battle for control over "Zwarte Wind", an offshore wind turbine park<br>
    After each hands-on workshop, the results are discussed, and students receive a documented solution. Based on our successful trainings in the last years and the great and positive feedback, we released this updated advanced threat modeling training at Black Hat USA 2021.
    Some feedback from our Black Hat training attendees<br>

  Description: >- 
     Browser fingerprinting refers to a website's ability to infer the exact makeup of a user's browsing environment and differentiate that user from other users without the use of cookies and other stateful identifiers. Constructively, browser fingerprinting has the potential to protect users and websites by detecting bots, and differentiating between benign users and attackers impersonating these users using stolen credentials. Destructively, browser fingerprinting can be used as an invasive way of tracking users across websites, even when users delete their cookies and use their browser's private mode. In this training, we will review the history of browser fingerprinting and see how it is different from traditional cookie-based user-identification techniques but also more intrusive stateful techniques, such as, evercookies and HSTS-based tracking. We will methodically investigate how browser fingerprinting works and what attributes can go into a browser fingerprint, ranging from JavaScript-based and browser-based properties, to attributes about the user's graphics card and even the TLS stack of their browser. We will understand how browser extensions can be fingerprinted and to what extent off-the-shelf tools that advertise anti-fingerprinting capabilities can really deliver on their promises. Next to learning about all modern browser-fingerprinting techniques, the participants will get an opportunity to actively learn via a number of hands-on activities that involve perusing the DOM of different browsers searching for browser-specific artifacts, understanding the architecture and operation of the most popular open-source fingerprinting library, observing how the TLS stacks of different browsers and web clients can be revealed through fingerprinting, and evaluate popular anti-fingerprinting tools. The participants of this training will be able to walk away with not just a concrete understanding of browser fingerprinting (and how they can avoid its unwanted variant as users on the web) but also with the knowledge to assess whether and how they can constructively use browser fingerprinting in the authentication and intrusion-detection components of their web applications.

  Description: >- 
      This training is focused on finding web app security vulnerabilities automatically through the use of highly effective tools which 
      will be developed in the course of this training. A vast spectrum of topics will be explained, ranging from foundational ones and then 
      moving up to esoteric vulnerabilities that are realtively new which usually remain undetected. The main objective is to write scripts at 
      a very high speed that perform almost every stage of a web security assessment methodology using not well-known tricks which aren't implemented 
      in the tools that are used the most, including types of attacks that are still not wide-spread, certainly not massively known and very dangerous 
      (mentioned further on the outline). The language that will be used for building this arsenal of tools will be Python, because of the fact that 
      this language helps to write very clear code and it is very easy to comprehend. These utilities are completely original and more capable than 
      the public and commercial ones, with the advantage that they will be easily extendible by yourselves. The few already public tools that are way 
      too powerful won't be reinvented, but definitely covered in the explanations. If you already know Python, this workshop is perfect for you, because 
      the time taken to explain the language will be practically null because these tools are practically self-explanatory, thus you will be able to use 
      your time in developing utilities that will boost up the speed and flow of your daily work. If you do not know Python, this training is also perfect 
      for you: the language will be quickly, briefly and intuitively explained from a hacker perspective in order to develop scripts that you for sure will 
      be using in your every-day work. The explanations will be the very same tools that will be developed in the training, all of this to have a better 
      flow of how the training will advance. It will be extremely simple to learn it just by reading the code.If you already have experience in web app 
      security, this workshop might still be worthy of you attention because of the methods not yet widely popularly known detailed further in the outline, 
      and none of them can be found in any book just yet. Original techniques will be explained. Furthermore, most of the time will be used to construct 
      the pieces of your very own framework to accomplish web security assessments. Do not forget this will be a long session. It is recommended to bring 
      0xC0FFEE.

  Title: "Threat Modeling: From None to Done (1-day training course)"
  URL: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/global-appsec-us-2021-virtual-training-tickets-188589806187
  SectionId: sku_TMFNTD
  Description: >- 
      This session offers participants an interactive introduction to Threat Modeling, based on the instructor's learning and experience over the past several years. A primary focus of this course is the introduction of threat modeling activities into your organization's software development processes, to improve the overall quality and security of the applications you build. As a "convert" to the application security world, your instructor has developed his "expertise" in threat modeling by gathering information from a variety of sources. He's combined those learnings with his own experience to create a practical threat modeling approach he has successfully applied within his professional roles. In addition to addressing key questions around the "Five Ws," the presentation will cover the "Seven Questions" approach (an expansion of Shostack's "Four Questions") to developing a model, and include several interactive exercises to provide direct experience. A brief review of available modeling tools will also be included, along with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges for introducing Threat Modeling into your SDLC.
