  subject: We Deserve Rights 
  abstract: "Hackers have been mislabeled and treated as criminals due to socially constructed beliefs that have been pushed out by the public. In return, we face prosecution when doing our job and trying to keep the world safe from attackers. Current legislation has destroyed many lives of hackers who did not exploit and stayed within scope. In return, 1 out of 4 hackers don't submit vulnerabilities due to the ongoing fear of prosecution. This talk dives into the socially constructed beliefs that the world has towards hackers and how increasing public awareness is needed to change their mindset to update out-of-date legislation."

  subject: Request Forgery on the Web - SSRF, CSRF and Clickjacking
  abstract: This technical talk on various forms of request forgery is for the software developer who needs to build secure web applications. Cross-Site Request Forgery, or CSRF, will allow an attacker to trick a user into submitting a transaction they never intended to. This attack type requires very specialized defense. We will discuss various historical CSRF attacks and investigate a wide range of defensive strategies such as nonce tokens, SameSite cookies, and the double-cookie submit pattern. SSFF is a direct attacker category meant to trick your servers into making additional requests than never intended to. Clickjacking is a way to trick users into taking action and entering data into one site while another is collecting those events. We will be helping developers stop forgery on the web in this talk!
